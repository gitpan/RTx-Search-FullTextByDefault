NAME
    RTx-Search-FullTextByDefault - Search ticket subject and content by
    default from RT's simple search

DESCRIPTION
    RT's simple search normally only searches subjects when it finds
    unrecognized terms. It allows explicit content searching by using
    "content:hola" or "fulltext:"hello world"". Explicit subject searches
    are performed via bare quotes ("hi there") or "subject:hello".

    This RT plugin, when installed and enabled, changes the simple search
    default to search subjects and full content for any unrecognized term
    and all quoted phrases without a field prefix. Explicit subject- or
    content-only terms may be prefixed to indicate such.

    Note that the simple search explanation/documentation is not updated to
    reflect the new behaviour with this plugin installed. There is no good
    mechanism to do so in RT.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
